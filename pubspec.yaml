# Note: This package is a CLI scaffolding tool. It exposes an executable entrypoint
# (see `executables:` below). The package depends on Flutter for some templates
# and code generation, but it is not a Flutter plugin. The previous `plugin:` block
# was removed so the package isn't treated as a platform plugin.
